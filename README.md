# HTTP Server using Socket Programming

## Overview

This is a simple HTTP server implemented in Python using socket programming. The server follows the TCP/IP model and provides basic functionality to handle HTTP requests and responses.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have a good understanding of the following concepts before using this HTTP server:

- **Socket Programming:** Understanding of how sockets work is crucial as the server relies on socket programming to handle communication between clients and the server.

- **TCP/IP Model:** Familiarity with the TCP/IP model, its layers, and how it facilitates communication between devices.

- **TCP/IP Sockets:** Understanding of TCP/IP sockets, especially how they are used for communication between processes over a network.

- **HTTPS Headers:** Knowledge of HTTP headers, especially those related to secure communication (HTTPS). This is important for handling secure connections.

- **HTTP Verbs:** Understanding of HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and how they are used in client-server communication.

## Features

- **Basic HTTP Server:** Handles basic HTTP requests and responds with appropriate HTTP status codes.

- **TCP/IP Communication:** Implements communication using the TCP/IP protocol stack.

- **HTTPS Support:** Provides basic support for HTTPS communication, ensuring secure data transfer.
